# Belly Button - Module 12

For this module Challenge I included a font change, added a paragraph to describe to interactivity, and changed the color of the background. The website is interactive and allows the user to review individual Subject data. Simply click the drop down menu to the left and select whichever Subject ID you would like to see. The website will populate the data gathered.
